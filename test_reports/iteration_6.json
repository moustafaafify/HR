Task categories supported: asset_return, access_revocation, knowledge_transfer, documentation, exit_interview, clearance, administrative, other. Separation reasons: resignation, termination, retirement, contract_end, layoff. Offboarding statuses: not_started, in_progress, completed, on_hold. Clearance fields: clearance_hr, clearance_it, clearance_finance, clearance_manager, clearance_admin. Auto-complete triggers when all tasks are marked complete."
